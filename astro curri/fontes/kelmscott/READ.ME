Scriptorium Font Library - Shareware NoteThis font is distributed as shareware.  It is yours to use and enjoy for 30days, but at the end of that time, if you are still using it you are morallyobligated to send us the shareware fee.That money won't be wasted because we'll use it to upgrade our hardware andsoftware to bring you more and better fonts in the future.There are two ways to pay the shareware fee.1) You can send in $5 and keep on using this font and forget all about us.-- OR --2) You can send in $12 and we'll send you a disk with more than a dozen fontsfrom the  Scriptorium Font Library, which features a large number of unusualtext, display and calligraphic fonts in TrueType or Postscript format.If you've already registered and paid your full fee for a previous font, you canget purchase additional disks from the font library for $10, or update to thenewest versions of any fonts you already have for $5 per disk.PLEASE NOTE	The uploaded shareware versions of many of our fonts are not complete.They may include only the upper case characters.  The versions distributed ondisk have upper, lower and special characters, except in those cases where thereare none for a particular font.Ragnarok's scriptorium is dedicated to producing unusual historical and specialpurpose text and display fonts.
